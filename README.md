# Educare - Powerful Results Management System

> ## Educare is a powerful online School/College students & results management system dev by FixBD. This plugin allows you to manage and publish students results. This is a School/College students & results management plugin that was created to make WordPress a more powerful CMS.

Educare help you to easily control over your institute students at online. You can easily Add/Edit/Delete Students, Results, Class, Exam, Year, Extra field, Custom Result Rules, Auto calculations and much more... Also you can import & export unlimited students and results just one click!

### Current Features

#### Educare Marksheed Systems

Using this features admin (teacher) can add subject wise multiple student results at a same time. So, it's most usefull for (single) teacher. There are different teachers for each subject. Teachers can add marks for their specific subject using this feature. And can print all student marks as a marksheet. After, the mark addition is done for all the subjects, students can view and print their results when admin publish it as results. Also, teacher can publish single subject results. (We call it - THE GOLDEN FEATURES FOR TEACHER!).

#### Result Rules (Grading Systems):

In the preview version of Educare, admins can add results with only one (default) grading system. Now by adding (v1.2.0+) this feature admin can add his country result system/rules. So, <strong>Using this feature you (admin) can add, modify, manage or automatically calculate any type of result based on your country or demand</strong>. Eg: India, Bangladesh or US result GPA (CGPA) and calculation methods/rules are different. So, maintaining a defined result using one rule is a bit tricky. The result rule feature solves this problem. If you manage results for Indian students, you can add Indian grading system or rules. Also, you can add Bangladesh or US grading system in the same way. We know, it's a bit difficult. Please share your experience while using these features to improve Educare.
